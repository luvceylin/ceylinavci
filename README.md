# Ceylin Avci- Ceylin's Portfolio ‚Äî 

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! 

##  What This Project Is

**"Ceylin's Portfolio"** is a website I designed and coded to showcase both some art work and computer science work of mine. The site features:

- An interactive **envelope selection screen** where it opens on hover 
- Cute and expressive **design** that I feel truly reflects my personality and aesthetic
- 2 different curated **project sections** in order to display art and future coding projects seperately.

##  Why I Made This

I wanted a portfolio that felt like me and truly had feautures I liked looking at ! It later shifted more from a portfolio to a personal website where I experimented with css. I wanted to build a project that represents both sides of me, combining my interest in creative design with technical work. The envelope art, in particular, is a feature I had in mind from the start. By designing my own website, I was able to create my own little corner on the internet, and create a place to display future projects! I really believe I can continue to improve this website to better represent all the things I love!

##  How I Made It

I built this site with:

- **HTML5** 
- **CSS3** for all styling and animations (including the envelope hover effect)
- **Google Fonts** (`Ballet`, `Arima`, `Quicksand`, and `Dancing Script`) for expressive typography
- A warm, earth-toned **beige color palette** to reflect my aesthetic

The envelope animation was created entirely with HTML and CSS. It uses 3D transforms and keyframe transitions to simulate an envelope flap opening smoothly when hovered.

Most of the code was from past HTML knowledge, however my css effects and art/ newspaper required some research. I used ai to help debug the css envelope animation and to spot some conflicting css issues!!

##  What I Struggled With & What I Learned

### Challenges:
- **3D envelope animation:** I had not worked with hover effects before so getting the envelope to look right and align correctly took a lot of effort. 
- -**Getting CSS Grid to work the way I wanted:**  
  I originally tried to use CSS Grid to create a ‚Äúgallery wall‚Äù effect for my envelope art, but I couldn't get it to work. The images were different sizes and didn‚Äôt align the way I wanted. Everything looked too rigid or broken on smaller screens. 
-**Code got very unorganized:*
My indents were all over the place, my css had so many seemingly unneccesary and duplicate code that messed up the whole project when removed. It got really frustrating to try and fix one issue and cause several others. 

### What I Learned:
- How to **use 3D CSS transforms** 
- How to **debug** 
-How to stay **organized** when writing code
