My personal website!
hello!
As of right now, there are a few interactive features. Click on the 'view my portfolio' button 
and then you can select and click an envelope to see either some art work or my computer science work
(empty for now as i have no super impressive projects) 

I am working through this to figure out how github works so sorry if key features suck haha. 

I used ai to help create css envelope animation and to spot some conflicting css issues!!
